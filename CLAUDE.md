## Tech Stack

- [docs/architecture/README.md#tech-stack](./docs/architecture/README.md#tech-stack) 

## Project Structure

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#project-structure) — directory layout
- [docs/architecture/README.md](./docs/architecture/README.md) — component architecture

## Common Commands

- `make help` — list all targets ([Makefile](./Makefile))
- Always use `make` targets for build, test, lint, format, setup, and distribution. Do not run `cargo`, `npm`, `python`, `go`, or `cbindgen` directly when a make target exists — the Makefile encapsulates correct flags, cross-compilation, environment setup, and ordering.

## Code Style

- [docs/development/rust-style.md](./docs/development/rust-style.md)

## Workflow

Every change goes: understand → research → design → implement → test → verify. Leave the code easier to read, test, and change than you found it. Make small, deliberate changes that directly support the task; don't rewrite or reformat unrelated code.

**Understand**

- Read this file, the nearest README/CONTRIBUTING, relevant docs, and the actual source before editing.
- Identify the smallest behavioral change that satisfies the request.
- Check the existing naming, module layout, test style, logging, and error-handling conventions in the affected area.
- Look for nearby tests or scripts that already define expected behavior.
- Reproduce-before-fix: when fixing a bug, write the failing test first, observe it fail, then fix. Do not create tests that don't actually test project code. A test that only exercises stdlib or framework code is not a real test.
- If docs and implementation disagree, capture the conflict and ask before making architectural assumptions.

**Research**

- Cite real `file:line` refs from similar projects. The user routinely asks "research other projects" if this step is skipped.

**Design**

- Don't be yes-man — challenge assumptions (yours too); ask whether a layer needs to know what you're about to teach it.
- Search before implement — `grep` for existing code first.
- Single responsibility — one function, one reason to change.
- One level of abstraction per function — don't mix orchestration with parsing, validation, persistence, rendering.
- **High cohesion, loose coupling via struct facade:** group related state + behavior into a struct; expose 1-2 `pub` entry points; keep internals + helpers private (minimizes cross-module knowledge). *Anti-pattern:* scattered free `pub fn`s callers must stitch together — leaks call order, helper graph, and shared state into every call site; every new caller re-learns the workflow. *Example:* [`ImageManager`](src/boxlite/src/images/manager.rs) exposes `new`/`pull`/`list`/`load_from_local` and hides `Arc<ImageStore>`, blob sources, manifest handling. *Exception:* stateless utilities (e.g., [`jailer/common/`](src/boxlite/src/jailer/common/) async-signal-safe helpers).
- Co-locate related code — fields, methods, and helpers that work together stay in the same file/module.
- DRY when it's the same rule, policy, or transformation. Tolerate small local duplication when an abstraction would hide important local behavior.
- Validation at the boundary — untrusted inputs get checked where they enter; trust internal code.
- Composition over inheritance / framework magic.
- Only what's used — no future-proofing; delete dead code immediately.
- No premature optimization — measure first.

**Implement**

- Boring code — obvious > clever. Code is read more than written.
- Names reveal intent, domain, and units. Booleans are predicates (`is_ready`, `has_token`, `can_retry`). Avoid `data`/`info`/`tmp`/`thing`/`handle`/`process` outside tiny scopes. Don't reuse one variable for two concepts in the same scope.
- Guard clauses + early returns over deeply nested control flow.
- Short argument lists. Group related values into typed options. Don't use boolean flags that make one function do two workflows — split them.
- Visible side effects: network calls, file writes, process exec, DB mutations should be explicit at the call site.
- Explicit errors — fail fast on missing config / invalid inputs; include operation, resource id, endpoint/status, input shape. Preserve the original cause when wrapping. Never swallow silently. Mask secrets in errors and logs.
- Explicit paths — calculate from known roots, never assume.
- Prepare before execute — setup before irreversible operations.
- No `sleep` for events — channels/waitpid/futures.
- Concurrency: timeouts, retries, cancellation explicit for external work. No unbounded queues/concurrency/memory. Close/release files, sockets, clients, browser handles, subprocesses. Retry loops must be idempotent (or document why safe).
- Security: no secrets in commits, logs, or test fixtures. Validate before SQL/shell/URL/path/HTML/prompt. Avoid shell execution with untrusted input.
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*: non-obvious intent, hidden constraints, deliberate trade-offs. Delete comments that restate the code or preserve dead decisions. Update nearby comments when behavior changes. Don't paste long excerpts from books, tickets, or logs.
- Follow the repository's existing formatter, linter, language level, and module style. Keep diffs focused — no whitespace churn outside touched lines. Add a new dependency only when it materially reduces risk or complexity.

**Test**

- Two-side verification for reproducer tests. When you add a test alongside a fix, demonstrate it in this order, both manually run:
    1. You must revert **every** production change — every non-test file back to its pre-fix state, only the test remains. Run the test. It must fail, with the failure pointing at the bug — log the observed failure signal (assertion text, hang, panic). **Partial reverts, mental simulation, or "it would obviously fail without the fix" are treated as cheating.** If a full revert is genuinely impractical, stop and surface that — do not paper over it.
    2. Restore the production change in full. Run the test. It must pass.
       Without a complete step 1 you've only proved your code works, not that the fix was necessary or that this test would have caught the bug. Don't accept "it passes now" as evidence the test guards the right thing.
- A test is only meaningful when there's something that could go wrong between the data being produced and the assertion being made. If the test builds the value it then asserts on (e.g., `format!`-ing a string and then asserting that the same string contains a substring it just put in), the assertion is tautological — nothing crossed a boundary, so nothing is being tested. The data must come from production code under test, not from the test body itself.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes around branching, parsing, retries, security checks, or boundaries.
- Prefer focused tests that prove the *right* reason for the change.
- Do not create tests that don't actually test project code. A test that only exercises stdlib or framework code is not a real test.
- Temporary tests that don't reference a project symbol must be written to a temporary directory — they are not production tests.
- Never weaken a test to force it green — fix the code under test, not the assertion.

**Verify** (before reporting done)

- Run the smallest relevant verification first (`make test`, package-scoped test), then broaden if risk justifies.
- Don't claim tests passed unless they actually ran. If verification can't run, state the blocker and the residual risk.

**Cross-cutting** (apply at every phase)

- Verify external findings against the working tree before acting. `/codex:adversarial-review`, lint, and PR comments work from a snapshot — they may name deleted code. `git grep` and `git diff` first.
- Treat every failure as a class, not an instance: when one surfaces, find and fix every sibling of the same shape in the same pass — grounded in what's actually there, not speculation. A single-site fix to a systemic bug isn't done.
- Honor scope reduction: "drop X" means drop X. Don't bundle adjacent improvements unprompted.

**Communication**

- Words: as concise and simple as possible, unless explicitly asked otherwise.
- A simple call graph (func name, class name, file name, LOC, short annotation) is the first choice when explaining code.
- Commit/PR text: describe the change, not the process that produced it. Conventional-Commit subject ≤72; no process/AI narrative, pasted logs, or secrets. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#commit--pr-messages).
