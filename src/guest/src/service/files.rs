/// kernel resolves the whole path in one step and reinterprets every absolute
/// symlink and `..` against `root`, so a swapped ancestor lands back inside the
/// rootfs instead of outside it. Confining rather than refusing is deliberate —
/// images ship symlinked directories (`/lib -> usr/lib` on `python:3-slim`,
/// `/var/run -> ../run` on `redis:7.4-alpine`), and refusing those would leave
/// a copy to `/lib/x` extracted but still root-owned, which is the ownership
/// bug this hand-off exists to fix.

// decoration: `examples/python/02_features/copy_files.py` and
// `examples/node/cp_tmpfs_workaround.js` both *fail closed* on the
// `'<mount>' mount` fragment — matching a bare `/tmp` would also match the
// runtime's own staging tar path — so a rewording that drops it turns both demos
// into hard errors with nothing else going red. The three live together so a
// rewording of one is read next to the others, and
// [`tests::every_mount_refusal_names_the_mount_the_way_the_examples_match`] pins
// the fragment in each.
