//! BoxLite Core - Shared code for host and guest
//!
//! This crate contains common types, protocols, and utilities
//! used by both the host-side runtime (boxlite) and guest agent.

/// Short git commit of the checkout this build came from.
///
/// `None` when the build script found no git checkout to read (published
/// crate, vendored source, container without `.git`) — see `build.rs`.
///
/// Provenance, never correctness. The same commit can produce different bytes
/// (debug vs release, a dirty tree), and a binary reached through
/// `BOXLITE_RUNTIME_DIR` need not come from it at all — so nothing may depend
/// on two artifacts sharing a commit meaning they share contents.
///
/// It may still *appear* in a cache path, where it costs a split for
/// byte-identical content and buys the ability to say which checkout produced
/// an artifact. That trade is only worth taking where the split is bounded —
/// see `EmbeddedRuntime::dir_name`, and note the guest rootfs key deliberately
/// declines it.
pub const GIT_COMMIT: Option<&str> = option_env!("BOXLITE_GIT_COMMIT");

/// A stream of byte chunks carrying a terminal `Err` item on producer failure.
///
/// The transfer wire format (today: tar) is deliberately absent from the name —
/// callers move opaque bytes and never inspect them.
