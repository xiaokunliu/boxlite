## Tech Stack

- [docs/architecture/README.md#tech-stack](./docs/architecture/README.md#tech-stack)

## Project Structure

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#project-structure) — directory layout
- [docs/architecture/README.md](./docs/architecture/README.md) — component architecture

## Common Commands

- `make help` — list all targets ([Makefile](./Makefile))
- Always use `make` targets for build, test, lint, format, setup, and distribution. Do not run `cargo`, `npm`, `python`, `go`, or `cbindgen` directly when a make target exists — the Makefile encapsulates correct flags, cross-compilation, environment setup, and ordering.

## Code Style

- [docs/development/rust-style.md](./docs/development/rust-style.md)

## Commit & PR Messages

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#commit--pr-messages) — the local rules and before/after call-graph example that the shared Communication rules below point at.

## Local Exemplars

- High-cohesion facade (the shared Design rule's exemplar here): [`ImageManager`](src/boxlite/src/images/manager.rs) exposes `new`/`pull`/`list`/`load_from_local` and hides `Arc<ImageStore>`, blob sources, and manifest handling.
- Facade exception — stateless utilities: [`jailer/common/`](src/boxlite/src/jailer/common/) async-signal-safe helpers.

## Workflow

Every change goes: understand → research → design → implement → test → verify. Leave the code easier to read, test, and change than you found it. Make small, deliberate changes that directly support the task; don't rewrite or reformat unrelated code.

**Understand**

- Read this file, the nearest README/CONTRIBUTING, relevant docs, and the actual source before editing.
- Identify the smallest behavioral change that satisfies the request.
- Check the existing naming, module layout, test style, logging, and error-handling conventions in the affected area.
- Look for nearby tests or scripts that already define expected behavior.
- Reproduce-before-fix: when fixing a bug, write the failing test first, observe it fail, then fix. Do not create tests that don't actually test project code. A test that only exercises stdlib or framework code is not a real test.
- If docs and implementation disagree, capture the conflict and ask before making architectural assumptions.

**Research**

- Cite real `file:line` refs from similar projects. The user routinely asks "research other projects" if this step is skipped.

**Design**

- Don't be yes-man — challenge assumptions (yours too); ask whether a layer needs to know what you're about to teach it.
- Search before implement — `grep` for existing code first.
- Single responsibility — one function, one reason to change.
- One level of abstraction per function — don't mix orchestration with parsing, validation, persistence, rendering.
- **High cohesion, loose coupling via a facade:** group related state + behavior into one type or module; expose 1–2 public entry points; keep internals and helpers private (minimizes cross-module knowledge). _Anti-pattern:_ scattered free public functions callers must stitch together — leaks call order, helper graph, and shared state into every call site; every new caller re-learns the workflow. _Exception:_ stateless utility modules of small pure helpers. Concrete in-repo exemplars belong in each repository's own instructions.
- Co-locate related code — fields, methods, and helpers that work together stay in the same file/module.
- DRY when it's the same rule, policy, or transformation. Tolerate small local duplication when an abstraction would hide important local behavior.
- Validation at the boundary — untrusted inputs get checked where they enter; trust internal code.
- Composition over inheritance / framework magic.
- Only what's used — no future-proofing; delete dead code immediately.
- No premature optimization — measure first.

**Implement**

- Boring code — obvious > clever. Code is read more than written.
- Names reveal intent, domain, and units. Booleans are predicates (`is_ready`, `has_token`, `can_retry`). Avoid `data`/`info`/`tmp`/`thing`/`handle`/`process` outside tiny scopes. Don't reuse one variable for two concepts in the same scope.
- Guard clauses + early returns over deeply nested control flow.
- Short argument lists. Group related values into typed options. Don't use boolean flags that make one function do two workflows — split them.
- Visible side effects: network calls, file writes, process exec, DB mutations should be explicit at the call site.
- Explicit errors — fail fast on missing config / invalid inputs; include operation, resource id, endpoint/status, input shape. Preserve the original cause when wrapping. Never swallow silently. Mask secrets in errors and logs.
- Explicit paths — calculate from known roots, never assume.
- Prepare before execute — setup before irreversible operations.
- No `sleep` for events — channels/waitpid/futures.
- Concurrency: timeouts, retries, cancellation explicit for external work. No unbounded queues/concurrency/memory. Close/release files, sockets, clients, browser handles, subprocesses. Retry loops must be idempotent (or document why safe).
- Security: no secrets in commits, logs, or test fixtures. Validate before SQL/shell/URL/path/HTML/prompt. Avoid shell execution with untrusted input.
- Comments explain _why_, not _what_: non-obvious intent, hidden constraints, deliberate trade-offs. Delete comments that restate the code or preserve dead decisions. Update nearby comments when behavior changes. Don't paste long excerpts from books, tickets, or logs.
- Follow the repository's existing formatter, linter, language level, and module style. Keep diffs focused — no whitespace churn outside touched lines. Add a new dependency only when it materially reduces risk or complexity.

**Test**

- Two-side verification for reproducer tests. When you add a test alongside a fix, demonstrate it in this order, both manually run:
  1. You must revert **every** production change — every non-test file back to its pre-fix state, only the test remains. Run the test. It must fail, with the failure pointing at the bug — log the observed failure signal (assertion text, hang, panic). **Partial reverts, mental simulation, or "it would obviously fail without the fix" are treated as cheating.** If a full revert is genuinely impractical, stop and surface that — do not paper over it.
  2. Restore the production change in full. Run the test. It must pass.
     Without a complete step 1 you've only proved your code works, not that the fix was necessary or that this test would have caught the bug. Don't accept "it passes now" as evidence the test guards the right thing.
- A test is only meaningful when there's something that could go wrong between the data being produced and the assertion being made. If the test builds the value it then asserts on (e.g., formatting a string and then asserting that the same string contains a substring it just put in), the assertion is tautological — nothing crossed a boundary, so nothing is being tested. The data must come from production code under test, not from the test body itself.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes around branching, parsing, retries, security checks, or boundaries.
- Prefer focused tests that prove the _right_ reason for the change.
- Do not create tests that don't actually test project code. A test that only exercises stdlib or framework code is not a real test.
- Temporary tests that don't reference a project symbol must be written to a temporary directory — they are not production tests.
- Never weaken a test to force it green — fix the code under test, not the assertion.

**Verify** (before reporting done)

- Run the smallest relevant verification first (the narrowest target the repo's tooling offers — a package-scoped test, a single suite), then broaden if risk justifies.
- Don't claim tests passed unless they actually ran. If verification can't run, state the blocker and the residual risk.

**Cross-cutting** (apply at every phase)

- Verify external findings against the working tree before acting. Reviews, lint, and PR comments work from a snapshot — they may name deleted code. `git grep` and `git diff` first.
- Audit verdicts through the Stop gate: when a turn asserts something as established — a fix that works, tests that pass, a root cause, an ops/infra finding, "no issues", a factual answer — let the gate triage the final turn. When an audit is required, the Stop hook runs the independent `verdict-auditor` synchronously against the exact transcript and a session-scoped generation; the auditor (never you) writes the dossier. If a real user message is steered in while it waits, the prompt hook revokes that generation and the runner cancels its process group; the abandoned dossier cannot authorize a later turn. PASS is silent: the original answer remains the user-facing conclusion and the hook emits no feedback or audit metadata. FAIL blocks with concise findings only; revise the answer to address them and end the turn again, and the gate re-audits the revision automatically. The Stop gate triages the WHOLE final turn (every assistant text since the last real user message) straight from the transcript — triage is a three-tier cascade, cheapest first: text the _harness_ wrote into the assistant slot (API errors, quota notices) asserts nothing and is allowed with no model call; a small set of assertion-only forms ("173/173 tests pass", a line-initial "Verified …", a whole-line "done.") audits with no classifier call; everything else goes to a fast model judging "is this a conclusion the reader must take on trust, with nothing shown that produced it?" — so a turn that quotes the output, counts or file:line behind its claims ends freely, while one that just asserts the result is audited — falling back to a curated pattern list (EN+中文) when no model is reachable. Prose-ambiguous phrasings ("tests pass", "root cause is", "deploy is healthy") stay with the model on purpose, so a turn merely _discussing_ verdict wording is still allowed. Triage allows announce their decision to the human via systemMessage (invisible to the model); dossier PASS is the deliberate silent exception. A session-scoped FAIL keeps blocking unchanged retries until its findings are addressed, and a still-fresh FAIL is parked to the matching previous-dossier path when the tree moves so the next audit re-checks those findings instead of starting cold; stale/mismatched dossiers are discarded and aged-out ones dropped outright, never blocked on. Chat and question turns end freely; when the turn text has not reached the transcript yet the gate waits briefly, and if it still cannot read it the turn ends UNJUDGED under a `blind-allow` rung; a judged message is never judged twice (flush-race guard). Triage can misread — declaring remains your duty, not only the hook's.
- An auditor still running after 30 seconds opens one interactive choice on hosts that support asynchronous re-wake: Keep waiting, or Force pass because the auditor is taking too long. No response leaves the auditor running. The host cannot dismiss an outstanding question when PASS/FAIL arrives, so a stale card may remain; its generation-bound selection is rejected after terminal completion or replacement. Other hosts publish a non-blocking typed status instead. The first non-empty line `force-pass-auditors: <required reason>` remains the headless/accessibility fallback. An override is recorded as `OVERRIDDEN BY USER`, never PASS, expires within one hour, and is revoked by the next real prompt. It bypasses only `commit-push-auditor` and `verdict-auditor`; installation/guidance checks, PR-review acknowledgement, chained hooks, push ref binding/watchers, permissions, and remote protections still run.
- Honor scope reduction: "drop X" means drop X. Don't bundle adjacent improvements unprompted.
- Treat every failure as a class, not an instance: when one surfaces, find and fix every sibling of the same shape in the same pass — grounded in what's actually there, not speculation. A single-site fix to a systemic bug isn't done.

**Communication**

- Words: as concise and simple as possible, unless explicitly asked otherwise.
- A simple call graph (func name, class name, file name, LOC, short annotation) is the first choice when explaining code.
- Commit/PR text: describe the change, not the process that produced it. Conventional-Commit subject ≤72; no process/AI narrative, pasted logs, or secrets. Local rules and examples live in the repository's CONTRIBUTING.
- Every PR description carries a before/after end-to-end call graph — same shape as the graph above. Bug fixes mark the faulty hop `← BUG: …` in _Before_ and link the issue (`Fixes #<n>`). Enforced by the pinned agent-tooling preflight hook; rule and example in the repository's CONTRIBUTING.
