"""E2E port of `src/boxlite/tests/shutdown.rs`.

The Rust file's `Boxlite::shutdown()` semantics don't translate directly
to REST mode (the runtime is a stateless REST client). This file covers
what shutdown means at the REST layer:

  - Calling `close()` (or letting the runtime drop) does not leak
    boxes — a new runtime sees the same world.
  - Read operations are still safe after the first runtime is dropped
    when a second runtime against the same API is built.
  - A double-close is a no-op (idempotent).
