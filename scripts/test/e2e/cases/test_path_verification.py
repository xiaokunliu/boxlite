"""Meta-test: prove the e2e suite actually goes through SDK → API → Runner.

The check is two-part:

  (1) The SDK's configured runtime URL is the API on :3000 (not the
      runner's :8080, and not a default-FFI degenerate). Asserted by
      inspecting the runtime's BoxliteRestOptions before any work runs.

  (2) After one round-trip exec, the runner journal contains the box id.
      Runner journal entries (`CREATE_BOX` / `created box id=…
      name=<uuid>`) only ever appear when the API queued the job, which
      only happens when the SDK POSTed to the API on :3000. So a single
      runner-journal hit is sufficient evidence for the whole chain.

If either check fails, downstream regression tests cannot be trusted —
they may be passing because they're talking to something other than the
production exec path.
