"""E2E coverage of the Execution.attach / reattach REST path.

The Python SDK's `box.attach(execution_id)` rewires a fresh WebSocket
to an existing execution session. Regressions here are silent —
streams iterate against the *wrong* exec, returning empty or stale data.

Runner-side handler tests (`apps/runner/pkg/api/controllers/boxlite_exec_attach_test.go`)
cover the framing; nothing covers the SDK ↔ API client side end-to-end.

Concurrent attach to the same execution is intentionally rejected by
the runner ("session has another client attached"). We don't test that
shape — covered by handler-level tests.

Cases:
  - reattach after the original session closes returns a usable handle
    with consistent execution id
  - attach with a bogus execution_id surfaces a typed client error
    (not a 5xx, not a silent no-op)
